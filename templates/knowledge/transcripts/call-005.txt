[00:00] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Greenfield Auto Group, Sarah speaking.

[00:03] Customer Rachel Nguyen: Hi Sarah, this is Rachel Nguyen — David's wife. He spoke with you yesterday about the Ford Lightning?

[00:10] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Rachel, yes! David mentioned you'd be joining him Wednesday evening for the test drive. Everything still good for 6pm?

[00:17] Customer Rachel Nguyen: Yes, we'll be there. I just had a quick question. David is set on the Lightning but I wanted to know — do you have any plug-in hybrids? I'm a little worried about going full electric for our only truck.

[00:30] Agent Sarah Mitchell: That's a completely valid concern. We do carry the Ford Maverick Hybrid — it's a compact truck but it's not a plug-in. For a plug-in hybrid truck, the closest option would be the Toyota Tundra i-Force MAX, which is a hybrid full-size truck. It's not a plug-in either but it does use both gas and electric motors.

[00:50] Customer Rachel Nguyen: Hmm, so there aren't really plug-in hybrid trucks right now?

[00:54] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Not many on the market yet. The Stellantis Ram 1500 Ramcharger is coming but it's not available yet. For now it's really a choice between the all-electric Lightning and traditional hybrid trucks. The Lightning does have the advantage of the 320-mile extended range though, and with David's office charger you'd rarely worry about range.

[01:12] Customer Rachel Nguyen: That's true. And he said the home charger is included?

[01:16] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Yes, Ford includes a complimentary 240-volt home charger. A licensed electrician can install it in about two hours. Typical installation cost is around $500-800.

[01:28] Customer Rachel Nguyen: Okay, that's not bad. I think I just need to drive it and see for myself. We'll both be there Wednesday.

[01:34] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Perfect. I'll make sure the extended range model is fully charged. And Rachel — I'll also have a Ford Maverick Hybrid on hand just in case you want to see a smaller, more affordable option. The Maverick starts at $23,000 and gets 42 mpg in the city.

[01:50] Customer Rachel Nguyen: That's actually really interesting too. My commute is only about 15 minutes so something smaller might work for a second vehicle.

[01:58] Agent Sarah Mitchell: A lot of families do exactly that — the Lightning for the primary vehicle and a Maverick as the commuter. The combined fuel and energy costs are very low.

[02:08] Customer Rachel Nguyen: Smart. We'll look at both on Wednesday. Thanks Sarah!

[02:12] Agent Sarah Mitchell: See you then, Rachel. Have a great evening!

Outcome: Confirmed Wednesday 6pm appointment. Customer Rachel Nguyen (wife of David Nguyen) also interested in Ford Maverick Hybrid as second vehicle. Potential two-vehicle sale.
