[00:00] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Greenfield Auto Group, this is Sarah. How may I help you?

[00:04] Customer Angela Foster: Hi Sarah. My name is Angela Foster. I'm a fleet manager for Riverside Courier Services. We're looking to add five delivery vans to our fleet and I'd like to know what commercial options you carry.

[00:18] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Angela, thanks for reaching out. Fleet sales are one of our specialties. We carry the Ford Transit, the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, and the Ram ProMaster. What size are you looking for?

[00:30] Customer Angela Foster: We need cargo vans — high roof, extended length. Our drivers do local deliveries so reliability and cargo space are key. We're currently running older Sprinters and they've been great, but the maintenance costs are climbing.

[00:46] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Understood. If you've been happy with Sprinters, the 2024 models are a significant upgrade. The new 2.0L turbo diesel gets about 24 mpg on the highway and Mercedes has improved the infotainment and safety systems. For a fleet of five, I can also work with our commercial sales director, Marcus Webb, to get you volume pricing.

[01:08] Customer Angela Foster: What kind of volume discount are we talking about?

[01:12] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Typically for five or more units, we can offer 8-12% below MSRP depending on the configuration. The Sprinter 2500 High Roof 170" WB has an MSRP of $56,000. With fleet pricing you could be looking at $49,000-51,000 per unit.

[01:30] Customer Angela Foster: That's a significant savings. What about the Ford Transit as a comparison?

[01:35] Agent Sarah Mitchell: The Transit is a strong competitor. The High Roof Extended Length has similar cargo volume — 487 cubic feet versus 488 for the Sprinter. The Transit is less expensive at about $46,000 MSRP, and with fleet pricing you'd be around $41,000-42,000 per unit. Maintenance costs are also generally lower on the Transit.

[01:58] Customer Angela Foster: So the Transit is about $8,000 less per van. Over five units that's $40,000 in savings. But our mechanics know the Sprinter platform really well.

[02:10] Agent Sarah Mitchell: That's an important consideration. Retraining mechanics adds cost. I'd suggest having your lead mechanic come with you when you look at the Transit — the new ones are much more mechanic-friendly than previous generations. Ford also offers a fleet maintenance program.

[02:28] Customer Angela Foster: Good idea. Can we set up a meeting with Marcus to go over all the options? I'd like to bring our operations director, Steve Rossi.

[02:38] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Absolutely. How does next Tuesday at 10am work? We can do a full walkthrough of both the Sprinter and Transit, discuss financing and fleet maintenance packages, and give your team a chance to get hands-on.

[02:52] Customer Angela Foster: Tuesday at 10am is perfect. It'll be me, Steve Rossi, and possibly our head mechanic Carlos.

[03:00] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Great. I'll coordinate with Marcus Webb and we'll have everything ready. I'll also prepare a side-by-side comparison document covering specs, pricing, warranty, and total cost of ownership for both models.

[03:15] Customer Angela Foster: That would be extremely helpful. One more thing — do you offer commercial financing for fleet purchases?

[03:22] Agent Sarah Mitchell: We do. We work with Ford Commercial Lending and Mercedes-Benz Financial Services. Both offer fleet-specific financing with terms up to 72 months. We can also look at commercial leasing if that suits your business structure better.

[03:38] Customer Angela Foster: Great. Let's discuss all options on Tuesday. Thanks so much, Sarah.

[03:42] Agent Sarah Mitchell: Thank you, Angela. Looking forward to meeting you and the Riverside Courier team on Tuesday.

Outcome: Fleet consultation scheduled for Tuesday 10am with commercial sales director Marcus Webb. Customer is fleet manager for Riverside Courier Services, interested in 5 cargo vans (Mercedes Sprinter vs Ford Transit). Attendees: Angela Foster, Steve Rossi, possibly Carlos (mechanic). Very high-value fleet deal.
