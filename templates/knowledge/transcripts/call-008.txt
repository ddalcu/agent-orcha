[00:00] Agent James Park: Greenfield Auto Group, this is James.

[00:03] Customer Mike Torres: Hey James, this is Mike Torres. I was in on Saturday — Sarah showed me the Highlander Hybrid and the Pilot.

[00:11] Agent James Park: Hey Mike! Sarah mentioned you came in. How did the test drives go?

[00:16] Customer Mike Torres: Really well. My wife Elena and I both loved the Highlander Hybrid. The ride quality is amazing and the third row actually has enough legroom for our kids. We've pretty much decided on it.

[00:28] Agent James Park: That's great to hear! Sarah left some notes — you were looking at the Highlander Hybrid XLE in Celestial Silver, right?

[00:35] Customer Mike Torres: That's the one. We want to move forward but I had a question about the trade-in. I've got a 2019 Honda CR-V with about 55,000 miles. It's in good shape — no accidents, always serviced on time.

[00:50] Agent James Park: A 2019 CR-V in good condition with 55K miles is going to trade well. Based on current market values, you're probably looking at $20,000-22,000 trade-in value. That would bring the Highlander Hybrid down to about $19,500-21,500 before tax and fees.

[01:08] Customer Mike Torres: That's better than I expected. We were also wondering about extended warranty options. With three kids, this car is going to get a workout.

[01:18] Agent James Park: Smart thinking. Toyota offers ToyotaCare Plus which extends your maintenance coverage to 25,000 miles or 2 years. For bumper-to-bumper coverage, the Toyota Platinum VSA goes up to 8 years or 125,000 miles. For a family vehicle, I'd recommend the Platinum — it covers pretty much everything.

[01:38] Customer Mike Torres: How much does the Platinum warranty cost?

[01:42] Agent James Park: It depends on the term but typically $1,800-2,400. We can roll it into the financing so it barely affects your monthly payment. If you finance the full vehicle at current rates — Toyota is offering 3.9% APR for 60 months — your payment would be around $370-390 a month after the trade-in.

[02:02] Customer Mike Torres: Under $400 a month with the warranty included? That works for us. When can we come sign the papers?

[02:08] Agent James Park: I'll get the paperwork started today. How does Thursday evening work? We can finalize the trade-in appraisal on the CR-V, go through the financing, and you could drive home in the Highlander that night.

[02:20] Customer Mike Torres: Thursday at 6pm. Elena and I will both be there to sign.

[02:25] Agent James Park: Perfect. I'll also loop in Sarah since she started the relationship with you. She'll want to be there for the delivery.

[02:32] Customer Mike Torres: That would be great. She was really helpful. See you Thursday!

Outcome: Sale closing scheduled for Thursday 6pm. Customer purchasing 2024 Toyota Highlander Hybrid XLE in Celestial Silver. Trading in 2019 Honda CR-V (~$20K-22K value). Adding Platinum warranty. Financing at 3.9% APR/60 months. Sale closed — delivery scheduled.
